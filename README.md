# Higher Or Lower Application 

The way this app works is that the app initially selects a random number between 1 and 20. 
The user is supposed to guess numbers and submit, while the app prompts with a toast whether the random number is higher, lower, or equal to the random selection.
Once the number has been guessed, a new random number is selected and the game starts again.
